      <li>2 tsp hot sauce</li>
      <li>1 tsp salt</li>
      <li>1 tsp black pepper</li>
      <li>1 tsp paprika</li>

    <h3>Recipe</h3>

    <ol>
      <li>
        In a large bowl, combine buttermilk, hot sauce, salt, pepper, and
        paprika.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the chicken pieces and ensure they are fully submerged in the
        marinade.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 1 hour, up
        to overnight for better flavor absorption.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a separate large bowl, mix together the flour, cayenne pepper,
        paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, and black pepper.
      </li>
      <li>Fill a deep pan with vegetable oil, about 2-3 inches deep.</li>
      <li>
        Remove chicken pieces one at a time from the marinade, letting excess
        liquid drip off.
      </li>
      <li>
        Dredge each piece in the flour mixture, making sure it's fully coated.
        Shake off excess flour.
      </li>
      <li>
        Carefully place the coated chicken pieces into the hot oil using tongs.
      </li>
      <li>
        Fry until golden brown and the internal temperature reaches at least
        165°F (74°C), about 8-12 minutes depending on the size of the pieces.
      </li>
    </ol>
